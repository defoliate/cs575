Oregon State University Spring term 2020\n
Instructor: Professor Mike Bailey\n
Student: Qingxiao Yuan\n

I run p0 in my own machine-surface pro 6. The other projects were done in school server Flip/rabbit,DGX. Though it's in COVID-19 period and has great challenge everyday, I put enormous efforts in the projects and got fun during this term. Thanks for prof.Bailey and Braxton, the TA who offered greatest help for me.
