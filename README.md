## Oregon State University (Spring term 2020)<br>
Instructor: Professor Mike Bailey<br>
Student: Qingxiao Yuan<br>

I run p0 in my own machine-surface pro 6. The other projects were done in school server flip,rabbit,DGX. Though it's in COVID-19 period and has great challenge everyday, I put enormous efforts in the projects and got fun during this term. Thanks for prof. Bailey and Braxton, the TA who offered greatest help for me.
